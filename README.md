# Flask-Practice-Metis-Delivery
The purpose of this repository was to practice and learn Flask for web applications.  
This app was a front end for managing deliveries and orders to customers for a business. It could store, edit and search customer information, assign orders them, search for all orders and deliveries by driver names, and update deliveries accordingly.  
This project uses MySQL, Flask, Javascript, and Jinja templates.  
It's a basic app- barely any CSS or any design. Just forms and tables.


This was the database I used:

This is where you could search for customer information via phone number,lookup deliveries, or see completed deliveries.
