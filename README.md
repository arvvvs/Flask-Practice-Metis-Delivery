# Flask-Practice-Metis-Delivery
The purpose of this repository was to practice and learn Flask for web applications.  The scenario for this app was a
way to track and place orders.  A customer calls in, you look up the customer by phone, place order, and update the
order as needed.  
This project uses MySQL, Flask, Javascript, and Jinja templates.  
It's a basic file- barely any CSS or any design. Just forms and tables.
