# Flask-Practice-Metis-Delivery
The purpose of this repository was to practice and learn Flask for web applications.  The scenario for this app was a
way to track and place orders.  A customer calls in, you look up the customer by phone, place order, and update the
order as needed.  
This project uses MySQL, Flask, Javascript, and Jinja templates.  
It's a basic file- barely any CSS or any design. Just forms and tables.


This was the basic requirements I created for this app to learn flask: 

A table to store customer information.

Customer Name

Address

Phone Number

A table to store delivery orders

Order Number

Customer

Delivery Status

Delivery Address

Delivery Person

A table to store Delivery Drivers

Employee Name

A table to store delivery statuses

Status ID

Status (Example: ready for delivery, out for delivery, complete)

Web pages and forms to perform the functions in the following application use case description.
